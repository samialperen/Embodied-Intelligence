*Grimpoteuthis bathynectes* is belong to genus of pelagic umbrella octopuses known as the dumbo octopuses[1]. The name "dumbo" comes from their similar apperance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo.

To explain Umwelt of *Grimpoteuthis bathynectes* properly, one need to be aware of its living environment. They live in deep ocean floor at depths of around 3,000-4,000 meters [2]. According to [3], the known location of them is in the Tufts and Cascadia Abyssal Plains in the North Pacific off Oregon.

The *motorium* of this species mainly consist of two dorsal arms with 47-58 suckers[3] Thanks to pair of cirri in each sucker, they create current of water that help bringing food closer to their mouth or break[2]. Moreover, they also have two fins on its mantle for active locomotion by drifting through the water[1]. They can also use other types of locomition with the help of dorsal arms as it can be seen in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJifcX9Fmk). Lastly, they have an  u-shaped shell, which help passive protection[3].

Their *sensorium* is rather limited to their *motorium*. They have 2 eyes to sense the environment[1]. They have also tactile sensing thanks to suckers in their arms and their mantle shell[4]. Unfortunately, there are not too much information regarding their sensors repertoire[4].
