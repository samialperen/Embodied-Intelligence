# Autopoietic System Simulation in 2D using Python Turtle

In the python script named autopoietic_system.py, a simulation of an autopoietic system in 2D is implented using Python Turtle.
The inspiration comes from Varela-Maturana-Uribe paper[1].

### Prerequisities
* Python 3.5 (Lower versions should be fine)
* Python Turtle Library

## System Description
* Catalyst --> blue turtle
* Substrate --> green circle
* Link --> red circle
* bounded link --> blue circle

### Limitations
Motion and production parts in the appendix of [1] is implemented. However, disintegration part is not implemented.

### Results
You can see demo video of the results [here](/assignment3/videos)
